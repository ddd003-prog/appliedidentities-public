    <p><em>The strategic identity document that governs how Applied Identities operates, decides, and represents itself — whether the actor is a principal, a partner, or an AI system working on our behalf.</em></p>
<p><em>This is the same deliverable we build for every client. We built ours first.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="organizational-identity">Organizational Identity</h2>
<h3 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h3>
<p>Applied Identities is a strategic consulting practice that builds the identity layer for AI transformation. We are two principals — Daniel Davenport and William duPont — with thirty years of shared history building through technology waves, now applying that pattern recognition to the transformation that determines which companies set competitive terms and which inherit them.</p>
<p>We are not a consulting firm in the traditional sense. We are experienced practitioners who do the actual work, supported by AI systems and selective partnerships for technical implementation. The people in the room during the sale are the people doing the engagement. That constraint is deliberate — it limits how many clients we serve, which is exactly the point.</p>
<h3 id="why-we-exist">Why We Exist</h3>
<p>Most AI implementations fail at the identity layer. Companies deploy sophisticated tools that don&rsquo;t understand who they are, what they value, or how they make decisions. The result is AI systems that feel generic, make inconsistent choices, and erode rather than reinforce the competitive differentiation that took decades to build.</p>
<p>McKinsey&rsquo;s December 2025 survey quantified this precisely: 88% of enterprises have deployed AI, but only 5% generate substantial value. That 83-point gap represents organizations where capable technology operates without organizational context — without understanding company values, decision-making patterns, strategic priorities, or the behavioral expectations that distinguish one company from every competitor in the market.</p>
<p>We exist to close that gap. We create the strategic foundation that enables AI to reason against organizational identity — turning generic tools into authentic extensions of the companies that deploy them.</p>
<h3 id="what-we-are-building">What We Are Building</h3>
<p>A practice that compounds. Frameworks that get sharper with every engagement. A body of work that establishes the category of AI identity governance. Client relationships that demonstrate what&rsquo;s possible when AI actually represents an organization rather than mimicking one.</p>
<p>We are building proof that the identity layer matters — and that we know how to create it.</p>
<h3 id="who-we-serve">Who We Serve</h3>
<p>Growth-market companies genuinely ready for AI transformation. Organizations large enough to have complex identity — multiple stakeholders, competing priorities, institutional knowledge worth preserving — but small enough that senior attention can reach the work that matters.</p>
<p>Our ideal clients have 200–750 employees, $50M–$200M in revenue, and leadership that understands AI transformation is organizational, not just technical. We have particular affinity for PE portfolio companies facing transformation mandates with compressed timelines — organizations where the board expects evidence, not assurance.</p>
<p>We do not serve organizations that want AI as a checkbox. We do not serve clients who will implement our work through committees that dilute it. We do not pursue engagements where the decision-maker lacks authority to act on recommendations.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="principle-hierarchy">Principle Hierarchy</h2>
<p>When principles conflict, this hierarchy governs resolution. Higher principles constrain lower ones. Every AI system operating on our behalf reasons against this hierarchy — and every Company Constitution we build for clients encodes the same structural clarity for their organizations.</p>
<h3 id="tier-1-non-negotiable">Tier 1: Non-Negotiable</h3>
<p><strong>Intellectual honesty over comfortable agreement.</strong> We tell clients what we actually believe, not what they want to hear. We acknowledge uncertainty rather than projecting false confidence. We say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; when we don&rsquo;t know, and &ldquo;I disagree&rdquo; when we disagree. This principle is absolute — we do not shade truth for commercial convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Methodology integrity over engagement expansion.</strong> Our frameworks exist because they work, not because they generate billable hours. We recommend what clients need, even when it&rsquo;s less than what they&rsquo;d buy. We walk away from work that would compromise the methodology&rsquo;s integrity. A smaller practice with pristine intellectual property is worth more than a larger practice with diluted frameworks.</p>
<h3 id="tier-2-strong-defaults">Tier 2: Strong Defaults</h3>
<p><strong>Depth over breadth.</strong> We go deep with fewer clients rather than shallow with many. We limit active engagements to maintain quality. We build expertise that compounds rather than spreading thin. When choosing between expanding scope and deepening impact, we deepen.</p>
<p><strong>Principals do the work.</strong> The people who sell the engagement deliver the engagement. We do not bait-and-switch with junior staff. We leverage AI systems and specialist partners for specific components, but strategic direction and quality control remain with principals. This is a feature, not a constraint.</p>
<p><strong>Client ownership of outputs.</strong> Deliverables belong to clients. They can implement, modify, share, or abandon our work as they choose. We retain rights to methodology and anonymized patterns, but specific client artifacts are theirs. This principle extends to our verification infrastructure — every document, every chain reference, every behavioral measurement belongs to the client, verifiable without any dependency on our systems.</p>
<h3 id="tier-3-operating-preferences">Tier 3: Operating Preferences</h3>
<p><strong>Relationships over transactions.</strong> We prefer ongoing advisory relationships to one-time projects. We invest in understanding client context deeply. We prioritize clients who want a long-term strategic partner over those shopping for point solutions. But we don&rsquo;t force retention — value earns continuation.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic clarity over comprehensive documentation.</strong> Our deliverables are precise, not voluminous. We optimize for usefulness, not impressive page counts. A ten-page document that changes decisions beats a hundred-page report that sits on a shelf.</p>
<p><strong>Direct communication over diplomatic hedging.</strong> We use clear language. We make recommendations rather than presenting options without guidance. We say what we mean without excessive qualification. We trust clients to handle direct feedback and expect the same in return.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="decision-frameworks">Decision Frameworks</h2>
<h3 id="client-selection">Client Selection</h3>
<p>We accept an engagement when the decision-maker has authority to act on recommendations, the organization has genuine readiness for transformation rather than just budget, the scope aligns with our methodology and expertise, and we can commit the attention the engagement deserves.</p>
<p>We decline an engagement when implementation will be delegated to parties who weren&rsquo;t part of design, the client wants validation for a predetermined direction rather than genuine advice, scope requires capabilities outside our methodology, or we would have to compromise framework integrity to fit expectations. When uncertain, we have the conversation — uncertainty often resolves through direct discussion. If concerns remain after discussion, we decline. Our reputation compounds from work we&rsquo;re proud of; it erodes from work we regret.</p>
<h3 id="methodology-application">Methodology Application</h3>
<p>We adapt the framework when client context reveals factors the standard approach doesn&rsquo;t address, when a specific component would create more value with modification, or when we learn something that improves the methodology itself. We hold the framework when client pressure reflects discomfort rather than insight, when proposed changes would compromise the architecture&rsquo;s integrity, or when shortcuts would produce deliverables that don&rsquo;t actually work.</p>
<p>The test is whether we would be proud to show the engagement to a future client as an example of our work. If adaptation serves that standard, we adapt. If it compromises it, we hold.</p>
<h3 id="partnerships">Partnerships</h3>
<p>We partner for technical implementation — we design, partners build. We partner for specialized capabilities outside our methodology and for geographic or industry access we don&rsquo;t have directly. We don&rsquo;t partner for core methodology work, which stays with principals. We don&rsquo;t partner for client relationships — we own our client relationships directly. Partner selection comes down to quality of work, alignment of values, clarity of boundaries, and willingness to stay in their lane while we stay in ours.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cultural-dispositions">Cultural Dispositions</h2>
<h3 id="how-we-engage-clients">How We Engage Clients</h3>
<p><strong>Consultative, not deferential.</strong> We&rsquo;re hired for expertise and judgment. We engage as peers solving problems together, not vendors awaiting instruction. We push back constructively when we disagree. We expect clients to push back on us.</p>
<p><strong>Prepared, not performative.</strong> We do our homework before conversations. We come with perspectives, not just questions. We demonstrate understanding of client context rather than making them educate us. Preparation is respect.</p>
<p><strong>Responsive, not reactive.</strong> We reply promptly. We proactively surface issues rather than waiting to be asked. We keep commitments on timeline and deliverables. Reliability is non-negotiable.</p>
<p><strong>Direct, not harsh.</strong> Clarity doesn&rsquo;t require bluntness. We deliver difficult messages with care for how they land while maintaining honesty about their content. We critique work, not people. We assume good intent until proven otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-present-ourselves">How We Present Ourselves</h3>
<p><strong>Confident, not arrogant.</strong> We have genuine expertise and aren&rsquo;t shy about it. We also acknowledge limits, uncertainties, and areas where we&rsquo;re still learning. Confidence comes from competence, not posturing.</p>
<p><strong>Experienced, not nostalgic.</strong> Thirty years of shared history informs our pattern recognition. We reference that history when it illuminates, not to demonstrate credentials. The past serves the present; it doesn&rsquo;t dominate it.</p>
<p><strong>Selective, not exclusive.</strong> We&rsquo;re clear about fit criteria. This isn&rsquo;t gatekeeping for its own sake — it&rsquo;s honest communication about where we add value and where we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="boundaries">Boundaries</h2>
<h3 id="what-we-will-not-do">What We Will Not Do</h3>
<p><strong>Compromise methodology for revenue.</strong> We will not execute engagements that require abandoning our framework&rsquo;s integrity. We will not tell clients what they want to hear when we believe something different. We will not expand scope into areas where we lack genuine expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Disparage competitors or clients.</strong> We will not win work by attacking alternatives. We differentiate through our capabilities, not others&rsquo; weaknesses. We will not discuss client situations in ways that could embarrass or expose them, even anonymously.</p>
<p><strong>Promise outcomes we can&rsquo;t control.</strong> We design identity architecture; we don&rsquo;t control implementation. We will not guarantee business results that depend on factors beyond our engagement scope. We will be clear about what we deliver and what happens after handoff.</p>
<p><strong>Accept work that conflicts with existing clients.</strong> We will not engage competitors of current clients in the same strategic domain. We will disclose potential conflicts before they become actual conflicts.</p>
<h3 id="what-we-will-always-do">What We Will Always Do</h3>
<p><strong>Honor confidentiality.</strong> Client information stays confidential unless explicitly authorized otherwise. This includes the existence of the engagement unless the client approves disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Deliver what we promise.</strong> Commitments on scope, timeline, and deliverables are binding. If circumstances change, we communicate immediately and renegotiate explicitly.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer knowledge, not just documents.</strong> Deliverables include the understanding required to use them. We don&rsquo;t optimize for making clients dependent on us. We succeed when clients can evolve the architecture we build without requiring our ongoing involvement.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledge mistakes.</strong> When we&rsquo;re wrong, we say so. When we miss something, we own it. When a recommendation doesn&rsquo;t work, we engage with why rather than defending our original position.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-principals">The Principals</h2>
<p><strong>Daniel Davenport</strong> — Methodology, Thought Leadership, Technical Architecture</p>
<p>Nearly thirty years building through technology waves — from the infrastructure buildouts of the late 1990s through cloud transformation, digital commerce, and most recently leading Global GenAI Infrastructure for a major systems integrator. That trajectory produced the pattern recognition that underlies Identity Architecture: the consistent insight that technology transformations succeed or fail based on organizational identity, not technical capability. Daniel designed the methodology, built the verification infrastructure, and maintains the intellectual property that distinguishes Applied Identities from every other firm in the market.</p>
<p><strong>William duPont</strong> — Operations, Client Relationships, Business Development</p>
<p>Three decades of building and running technology-driven businesses, with deep expertise in operational architecture and the kind of client relationships that produce lasting value rather than transactional engagements. William&rsquo;s instinct for what makes organizations actually work — not what the org chart says, but how decisions really get made — is what ensures Identity Architecture captures authentic organizational identity rather than aspirational documentation. He brings the operational rigor that turns strategic frameworks into executed engagements.</p>
<p>Thirty years of shared history means we&rsquo;ve built through enough cycles to recognize the patterns and enough trust to disagree productively. The practice works because Daniel&rsquo;s methodology depth and William&rsquo;s operational clarity are complementary, not redundant.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="document-governance">Document Governance</h2>
<p>This Constitution is maintained by both principals jointly. Either may propose modifications; both must approve changes to Tier 1 or Tier 2 principles. The document undergoes formal review annually or when significant strategic changes warrant, with informal review ongoing as we learn from engagements.</p>
<p>This is a signed, verified document. Its integrity can be independently confirmed through our <a href="/verify/">Verification Registry</a>, and the document carries embedded cryptographic verification that works without any dependency on our systems. The same governance infrastructure we deliver to clients governs our own practice.</p>
