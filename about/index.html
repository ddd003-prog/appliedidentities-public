    <h1>About</h1>
    
    
    <h2 id="why-this-practice-exists">Why This Practice Exists</h2>
<p>We spent years building digital transformation inside organizations that didn&rsquo;t understand what we were building. Good ideas dying in committee. Vision translated into &ldquo;deliverables&rdquo; that satisfied procurement but solved nothing. Meetings where the goal was alignment, not progress.</p>
<p>We learned things in those years — how enterprises actually buy, how transformation actually fails, what governance actually requires. But we also lost things. The ability to say no to work that doesn&rsquo;t matter. The freedom to build intellectual property that compounds. The clarity that comes from choosing clients who are ready to transform rather than checking a box.</p>
<p>Applied Identities is the practice we&rsquo;ve spent three decades preparing to build. Not a lifestyle business. Not a consulting retirement plan. A genuine attempt to do work that matters with the rigor and honesty it deserves, on terms that let us stand behind every engagement.</p>
<h2 id="daniel-davenport">Daniel Davenport</h2>
<p>Daniel owns methodology, thought leadership, and technical architecture. Nearly thirty years across technology waves — from building the early commercial web through leading enterprise AI infrastructure for a global systems integrator — and the pattern recognition that produces.</p>
<p>The Identity Architecture methodology didn&rsquo;t emerge from theory. It emerged from eighteen months of building agentic systems hands-on: developing AI persona architectures, constructing knowledge verification infrastructure, and understanding precisely where agent workflows break under real operational pressure. Daniel also runs The Syntax Layer, an agentic media platform that serves as a working demonstration of the frameworks Applied Identities brings to clients — Identity Architecture applied to media, knowledge transmission, and AI-human collaboration.</p>
<p>That combination — strategic consulting grounded in active building — is what separates Applied Identities from firms that advise on AI transformation without having built the systems themselves. Daniel brings the cultural and behavioral depth most technology consultants overlook: understanding why organizations resist what would help them, and designing for meaning rather than just efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="william-dupont">William duPont</h2>
<p>William owns operations, client relationships, and business development. Thirty years of building and selling digital transformation — from founding agencies through acquisition cycles to enterprise client partnerships at scale.</p>
<p>What William sees that most strategy consultants don&rsquo;t: how organizations actually operate under pressure. He&rsquo;s managed 450 people across seven offices. He knows what scales, what breaks, and what makes transformation stick versus stall. He understands how enterprises actually buy — the internal politics, the budget cycles, the champion dynamics that determine whether a good idea gets funded or dies in committee.</p>
<p>William ensures that what we design survives contact with organizational reality. The methodologies are rigorous, but the engagements are structured around how work actually gets done — not how consultants wish it would.</p>
<h2 id="thirty-years-same-crew-different-wave">Thirty Years, Same Crew, Different Wave</h2>
<p>We built the commercial internet together. Not metaphorically — literally. From &ldquo;what&rsquo;s a website&rdquo; through &ldquo;what&rsquo;s a digital strategy,&rdquo; across web, mobile, social, and cloud. The same pattern recognition, applied to the transformation that carries the highest stakes we&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>What that history means in practice: no learning curve between us. We&rsquo;ve already had the arguments about methodology versus operations, about depth versus speed, about when to push and when to wait. We know where we disagree and why it matters. Complementary perspectives — William sees adoption and organizational reality, Daniel sees architecture and meaning — that don&rsquo;t overlap. Battle-tested trust from making payroll together, losing clients together, and navigating acquisitions together. The relationship infrastructure is already built.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-work">How We Work</h2>
<p>Applied Identities takes three to four active clients at a time. That constraint is deliberate — it&rsquo;s where the real value gets created. We go deep rather than wide, which means every engagement gets senior attention throughout, not just during the kickoff.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do staff augmentation or body-shop consulting. We don&rsquo;t build custom software — we design and specify; your team or partners build. We don&rsquo;t take engagements we don&rsquo;t believe in because the revenue looks good. And we&rsquo;re direct about fit: if we&rsquo;re not the right firm for what you need, we&rsquo;ll tell you and point you toward someone who is.</p>
<p>Our clients are growth-market companies — typically 200 to 750 employees, $50M to $200M in revenue — facing genuine AI transformation pressure. Often PE portfolio companies with transformation mandates and timelines. Organizations where the leadership team is ready to do real strategic work, not just commission a report that sits on a shelf.</p>
<h2 id="atlanta-georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</h2>
<p>Applied Identities is based in Atlanta with engagement delivery structured for both on-site and distributed work. Discovery workshops and executive interviews are most effective in person. Architecture development, ongoing advisory, and quarterly assessments work well remotely. We structure each engagement around what the work actually requires, not around a default billing model.</p>
