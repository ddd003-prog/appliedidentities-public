    <h2 id="why-this-practice-exists">Why This Practice Exists</h2>
<p>We spent decades inside organizations that deployed technology without understanding what they were deploying. Good strategy dying in translation. AI tools adopted because competitors adopted them, not because anyone defined what the AI should actually <em>represent</em>.</p>
<p>Applied Identities exists to solve one problem: the gap between deploying AI and deploying AI that knows who it&rsquo;s working for. We build the identity architecture that closes it.</p>
<h2 id="who-does-the-work">Who Does the Work</h2>
<p><strong>Daniel Davenport</strong> leads methodology, thought leadership, and technical architecture. Nearly thirty years across technology waves — from enterprise infrastructure through cloud transformation to leading global GenAI infrastructure for a major systems integrator. He builds Identity Architecture hands-on and publishes the frameworks that define the practice&rsquo;s intellectual foundation.</p>
<p><strong>William duPont</strong> leads operations, client relationships, and business development. Thirty-five years building executive talent networks and go-to-market infrastructure. He ensures engagements deliver what they promise and that the right clients find the practice in the first place.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve worked together for thirty-five years across multiple ventures. Both of us do the actual work. No junior consultants, no bait-and-switch. The people you meet are the people who deliver.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-work">How We Work</h2>
<p>We take three to four clients at a time. That constraint is the point — Identity Architecture requires deep engagement with organizational reality, not templated deliverables scaled across a portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Best fit:</strong> Growth-stage companies (200–750 employees, $50M–$200M revenue) deploying AI that represents the organization to customers, partners, or internal teams. PE portfolio companies with transformation mandates. Organizations where inconsistent AI behavior is already creating friction.</p>
<p><strong>Not the right fit:</strong> Companies looking for AI tool implementation, platform selection, or technical integration. We build the strategic layer that makes those investments work — not the implementations themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Based in Atlanta.</strong> Discovery workshops and executive interviews work best in person. Architecture development and ongoing advisory work well remotely. We structure each engagement around what the work requires.</p>
<div class="cta-section">
<h2 id="see-if-theres-a-fit">See if there&rsquo;s a fit</h2>
<p>A 30-minute conversation is enough to determine whether Identity Architecture applies to your situation — and whether we&rsquo;re the right people to build it. <a href="/contact/">Get in touch →</a></p>
