    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    
    
    <h2 id="the-problem-nobody-else-is-solving">The Problem Nobody Else Is Solving</h2>
<p>Every AI vendor sells capability. None of them sell identity. The result: sophisticated tools that operate without access to your strategy, your values, or your way of making decisions. Your AI can draft emails, analyze data, and automate workflows. It just can&rsquo;t tell the difference between how <em>your</em> company should respond and how any company would.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a training problem. It&rsquo;s an architecture problem. And it&rsquo;s why 88% of enterprises have deployed AI but only 5% generate substantial value from it.</p>
<h2 id="what-identity-architecture-does">What Identity Architecture Does</h2>
<p>We build the strategic identity layer that sits between your organization and every AI system you deploy. Five components, each designed so AI can reason against it directly:</p>
<p><strong>Company Constitution</strong> — your principle hierarchy, decision frameworks, and behavioral boundaries encoded in a format AI systems consume natively. When values conflict, your AI knows which wins. When stakeholders compete, it knows whose authority governs what.</p>
<p><strong>Company Memory System</strong> — institutional knowledge structured for retrieval. The context, history, and relationships your people carry in their heads, made accessible to every agent in your deployment.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Specifications</strong> — character and capability definitions per agent role. Each agent behaves appropriately for its function while remaining coherent with organizational identity.</p>
<p><strong>Human Orchestration Guide</strong> — the same principles translated for your team. Employees understand how AI reasons, can predict its behavior, and know when to override it.</p>
<p><strong>Interaction Protocols</strong> — coordination architecture for hybrid teams. Handoff specs, escalation triggers, and continuity patterns that keep human-agent collaboration seamless.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-works">Why This Works</h2>
<p>Anthropic invested 23,000 words in a constitution for a single AI system — and captured 32% enterprise market share doing it. That investment in identity architecture is the primary reason Claude behaves consistently across situations its designers never anticipated.</p>
<p>Your organization needs the same foundation. Not for one AI system, but for every agent, workflow, and customer interaction your AI deployment touches.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-actually-get">What You Actually Get</h2>
<p><strong>Discovery Assessment</strong> ($12–18K, 2–3 weeks) — Quantified Ground Truth baseline across six dimensions. Produces a readiness score, opportunity map, and recommended path forward. Most client relationships start here.</p>
<p><strong>Full Identity Architecture</strong> ($150–250K, 10–14 weeks) — All five layers designed, documented, and ready for implementation on your chosen platforms. Includes governance framework and evaluation infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Fractional AI Leadership</strong> ($16–24K/month, 6-month minimum) — Ongoing strategic advisory. Architecture oversight, vendor evaluation, and identity governance as your deployment evolves.</p>
<p>We build the strategic specifications. Your implementation team — internal or external — deploys them. This separation is deliberate: identity architecture should outlast any specific technology choice.</p>

<p>A Discovery Assessment is the fastest way to see where identity architecture creates the most value in your specific situation. <a href="/contact/">Start a conversation →</a></p>
