      "description": "Your best employees don't follow scripts — they internalize strategy and exercise judgment. Your AI systems should work the same way. Compiled Corporation encodes business logic so agents execute against your actual strategy rather than translating instructions at runtime. The organizations that compile first capture the efficiency gains and set the operational terms their competitors inherit."

AI agents evaluate through structured data, parseable attributes, and verifiable claims. Companies optimizing for only one audience are invisible to the other — and in agent-mediated commerce, invisible means excluded from consideration entirely."

      "description": "Every AI deployment creates a boundary between human judgment and algorithmic execution. Most companies let that boundary emerge accidentally — then wonder why handoffs fail, escalations misfire, and employees work around the system. Decision Surfaces designs that boundary intentionally: where delegation happens, what scope agents operate within, and what triggers human re-engagement."
